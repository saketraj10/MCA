    <h3>Leading the web to its full potential</h3>

    <p>Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium in 1994 to ensure the long-term growth of the Web.</p>

    <p>From the start the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been an international multi-stakeholder community where member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop open web standards.</p>

    <p>Led by Interim CEO Ralph Swick and a Board of Directors, the Web Consortium's mission is to lead the web to its full potential.</p>

    <h2>W3C Community</h2>

        <p>W3C's global standards constitute the toolkit for web solutions that scale, enabling innovators to solve hard problems, providing the proper foundations to meet requirements for accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security on the web.</p>

        <p>Standards that meet the varied needs of society are created not by one company but through the work of the Web Consortium community:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Members: More than 400 Members from around the world lead the development and implementation of standards.</li>
                <li>Staff: W3C is a public-interest non-profit organization whose revenues come primarily from Membership dues. These and some grants support a staff of about 50 people.</li>
                <li>Developers: Over 12,000 developers worldwide participate in the standards development.</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Working with stakeholders of the Web</h2>

    <p>A range of organizations join the World Wide Web Consortium as Members to work with us to drive the direction of core web technologies and exchange ideas with industry and research leaders. We rotate randomly a few of our Member organizations' logos underneath.</p>

    <p>The Web Consortium and its members, with help from the public and the web community, focus on a range of business ecosystems that the Web transforms, including E-commerce, Media & Entertainment, Publishing and several other areas.</p>
