Looking into the Linux kernel
The core of the Linux system is the kernel. The kernel controls all of the hardware and software on the computer system, allocating hardware when necessary, and executing software when required.

If you’ve been following the Linux world at all, no doubt you’ve heard the name Linus Torvalds. Linus is the person responsible for creating the first Linux kernel software while he was a student at the University of Helsinki. He intended it to be a copy of the Unix system, at the time a popular operating system used at many universities.

After developing the Linux kernel, Linus released it to the Internet community and solicited suggestions for improving it. This simple process started a revolution in the world of computer operating systems. Soon Linus was receiving suggestions from students as well as professional programmers from around the world.
